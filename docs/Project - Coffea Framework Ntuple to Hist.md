# Current
- Based on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pg_Ws8pkJAnU29qfHEiqUENpD7sTrM2y0UX5ISvCjyI/edit?tab=t.80l00hjza16|this]], the only site that need to have their iteration of this job updated is NERSC 
  
## Dump
- Working on getting the input files downloaded at NERSC:
  - Had to fix some merge conflicts between what was in my desktop and my laptop
  - I'm running into the same error as the other sites; release versions don't match
  - Will ask Giordon about it during our meeting later
- Working on updating all of the errors I have encountered at the sites
- Will just have to wait for my meeting with Giordon

TODO:
- [ ] I need to reinstall the ff packages for sites the following sites(I will simply use the code that I have for NERSC since that one works already):
  - [ ] NERSC
  - [ ] BNL
  - [ ] SLAC
