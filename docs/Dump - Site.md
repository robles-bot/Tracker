- Benchmarking Event Loop

## GPU Benchmarking Job
* Check if there's a standard GPU benchmark; use Ntuple
* Use one of the Physics 152 NB that is a CNN or GAN and see if I can run at UC and BNL (batch)
* Make it a standalone flowchart; consider incorporating into the rest of the flowchart


- Ask grad school advisor about openings in their institutions

## Python File for EVENT LOOP
- [ ] Run the python EVent loop produce a histogram in a root file and then compare with the other jobs FF and Coffea:
  - [ ] Implement into a job and run in the batch; compare the run time coffea and FF
- [ ] Have the average over x amount of days comparing the run time
- [ ] Report the code once it is done so that it can be faster; accessing arrays Pre-ID branches
- *TOP PRIORITY*


- Separate github for the "Provide an updated quickstart guide for UC-AF, following SW carpentries tutorial format" milestone; follow the same format that IRIS-HEP has
- It can be personal and show the carpentry material
- Update the carpentry
