- [ ] Implement new methods of parsing and cases as nets for the parsing scripts
- [ ] Check when Ilija will be back so I can prepare the migration over to the new parsing scripts
- [ ] Look into version control

## BNL

- [X] Schedule EVNT Parsing scripts
- [ ] Schedule TRUTH3 Parsing scripts:
  - [ ] Copy the usual files to the respective directories:
    - [ ] Native
    - [ ] EL9
    - [ ] CentOS7
    - [ ] Native int
    - [ ] EL9 int 
    - [ ] CentOS7 int
  - [ ] Write the main script for the respective jobs:
    - [ ] Native
    - [ ] EL9
    - [ ] CentOS7
    - [ ] Native int
    - [ ] EL9 int 
    - [ ] CentOS7 int
  - [ ] Create the "current_list.txt" file for the respective jobs:
    - [ ] Native
    - [ ] EL9
    - [ ] CentOS7
    - [ ] Native int
    - [ ] EL9 int 
    - [ ] CentOS7 int
- [ ] Update the FF code so that it matches what is being used at SLAC
- [ ] Fix the parsing script used by the coffea job
- [ ] Fix the parsing scripts in general

## SLAC
