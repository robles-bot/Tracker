# Current

TODO:

## BNL

- [ ] Schedule EVNT Parsing scripts


## SLAC

- [X] Fix the parsing scripts
- [ ] Figure out what is causing this error:
```bash
OSError: [Errno 121] Remote I/O error
```
- [ ] Set up the SLAC FF
- [ ] Get to the bottom of this on PDB, insert break points and see why the error is being thrown
- [ ] Check the paths and make sure it is still available
- [ ] If there is a file that is causing the issue, wrap it using a try-except and have it give an error message and give me the name of the file that is missing/faulty
- [ ] Keep the dashboard populated and don't move until it is guaranteed that there won't be issue


## UC

- [ ] Parse Ntuple -> Hist log files and compare both FF and Coffea
- [X] Compare Coffea, FF, and EventLoop histogram

## NERSC


## Site
- [ ] Add a legend to the flowchart -- red is scripts and blue is data formats
