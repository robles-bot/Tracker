# Current

TODO:

## General

- [ ] Discuss the idea of changing the parsing scripts to the new method

- [ ] Go over SLAC EVNT Log File with Mike
- [ ] Think about the structure of the Coffea parsing script (the merge request will help when parsing; will just need to find that specific block of text and parse; otherwise I would just be missing the block of text all the time):
  - [ ] Giordon will update the script via a merge request, see example below
   ```bash
   {'bytesread': 6392230, 'columns': ['ph_select_tightID_NOSYS', 'ph_pt_NOSYS', 'ph_isEM_NOSYS'], 'entries': 191297, 'processtime': 1.8725175857543945, 'chunks': 2}
   ```
- [ ] Learn how to use PDB
- [ ] Learn how to use Pyinstrument
- [ ] Look into version control
- [ ] Update the FF versions used at all the sites; have their versions match

## BNL

- [ ] Update the FF code so that it matches what is being used at SLAC

## SLAC


## UC

- [ ] Parse Ntuple -> Hist log files and compare both FF and Coffea
- [ ] Update the FF code so that it matches what is being used at SLAC

## NERSC

- [ ] Update the FF code so that it matches what is being used at SLAC

## Site

- [ ] Document the structure of the benchmarking job; do so for all sites; batch and interactive container jobs; documenting the parsing script as well; it should help people navigate the GitHub page; explain where the cron files are deployed at the various sites; basically explain everything I've done over the past year
- [ ] Call out where the user would go for an interactive set up for the environment and whatnot

# Ideas

- Email grad advisors and figure out if there will be openings for different programs and their application cycles *TOP* ask about *TA*
