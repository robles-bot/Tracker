# BNL - Rucio Dumps

- When running this I discovered an issue; if the job fails and can't append to the file "new_current_list.txt" there won't be any entry to look at the next time it runs so it wont' be able to send information. Found a quick fit but will have to tackle this problem later
- This job is running and hasn't had an issue since this morning
