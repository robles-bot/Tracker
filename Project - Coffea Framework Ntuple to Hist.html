Working on getting the input files downloaded at NERSC:

<ul>
<li>
Had to fix some merge conflicts between what was in my desktop and my laptop

<li>
I'm running into the same error as the other sites; release versions don't match

<li>
Will ask Giordon about it during our meeting later

</ul>
<li>
Working on updating all of the errors I have encountered at the sites

<li>
Will just have to wait for my meeting with Giordon
